In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, any household watching or recording live television transmissions as they are being broadcast (terrestrial, satellite, cable, or Internet) is required to hold a television licence. Businesses, hospitals, schools and a range of other organisations are also required to hold television licences to watch and record live TV broadcasts.[1] The licence, originally a radio licence, was first introduced by the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1923 in November of that year at a cost of ten shillings (£0.50) per annum. The licence was extended to televisions at a cost of £2 in June 1946. The radio part was abolished in February 1971.[2] A television licence is also required to receive video on demand programme services provided by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) on the iPlayer catch-up service.

Since April 2020, the annual cost is £157.50 for a colour licence and £53 for a black and white licence. Income from the licence is primarily used to fund the television, radio and online services of the BBC. The total income from licence fees was £3.83 billion in 2017–18[3] of which £655.3 million or 17.1% was provided by the government through concessions for those over the age of 75. Thus, the licence fee made up the bulk (75.7%) of the BBC's total income of £5.0627 billion in 2017–2018.[3]

The government's white paper of May 2016 announced that the licence fee will rise with inflation for the first five years of the Charter period, from 1 April 2017. 

Licence fee collection and use

The TV licence fee is collected by the BBC and primarily used to fund the radio, television and online services of the BBC itself. Licence fee collection is the responsibility of the BBC's Finance and Business division.[4]

Although the money is raised for its own use, the BBC does not directly use the collected fees. The money received is first paid into the government's Consolidated Fund. It is subsequently included in the 'vote' for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in that year's Appropriation Act, and passed back to the BBC for the running of the BBC's own services (free from commercial advertisements). The money also finances programming for S4C and the BBC World Service, and included the running costs of BBC Monitoring at Caversham until it was relocated to London and the property sold in May 2018. 

Legal framework

In 1991, the BBC assumed the role of TV Licensing Authority with responsibility for the collection and enforcement of the licence fee.[5]

The BBC is authorised by the Communications Act 2003 to collect and enforce the TV licence fee. Section 363 of the Act makes it against the law to install or use a television receiver to watch or record any television programmes as they are being broadcast without a TV Licence. Section 365 of the same Act requires the payment of the TV licence fee to the BBC.[5]

The licence fee is formally set by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport by the use of statutory instruments. The relevant statutory instruments are the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004[6] and amendments since that time such as the Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2010.[7] As well as prescribing the fees, the regulations also define "television receiver" for the purposes of the law.

For people living in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, TV licensing law is extended to their areas by Orders in Council made by agreement with their own governments.[8][9][10]

As part of its enforcement regime, the BBC is authorised to carry out surveillance using powers defined by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001. The BBC is permitted by the latter order to use surveillance equipment to detect unlicensed use of television receivers.[11]

As the public body responsible for issuing TV licences, licensing information held by the BBC and on the BBC's behalf by TV licensing contractors is subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The BBC withholds some information on licence enforcement using exemptions under the Act; in particular, under section 31, which permits the withholding of information on crime prevention grounds and under section 43(2), which allows the BBC to retain information judged commercially sensitive.[12]

Reclassification as a tax

In January 2006, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) changed the classification of the licence fee from a service charge to a tax.[13] Explaining the change the ONS said: "in line with the definition of a tax, the licence fee is a compulsory payment which is not paid solely for access to BBC services. A licence is required to receive ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, satellite, or cable". A briefing paper from the House of Commons Library described the licence fee as a hypothecated tax (i.e. one raised for a particular defined purpose).[14]
TV Licensing Management Team

The TV Licence Management Team, which is part of the Finance and Business division of the BBC, oversees the TV Licensing system.[15] The TV Licence Management Team is based in the BBC buildings at White City Place in London. The majority of TV licensing administration and enforcement activities are carried out under contract by private companies. The TV Licence Management Team oversees the performance of the contractors.
TV Licensing brand

The BBC pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name TV Licensing, but contracts much of the task to commercial organisations.[16] TV Licensing is a trademark of the BBC used under licence by companies contracted by the BBC that administer the television licensing system.[16] Concerning the relationship of the BBC brand with the TV Licensing brand, the BBC's position is: "The TV Licensing brand is separate from the BBC brand. No link between the two brands should be made in customer facing communications, in particular, use of the BBC name and logo".[17] However, it also states that the rules for internal communications and communications with suppliers are different and: "the name BBC TV Licensing may also be used within department names or job titles for BBC employees".[17]

Duration of a TV licence

A TV licence, once issued, is normally valid for a maximum of 12 months. The period of its validity depends on the exact day of the month it is purchased; this is because TV licences always expire at the end of a calendar month. If a licence were to be obtained in September 2014, for example, it would expire on 31 August 2015. Thus the period of validity would vary between 11 and 12 months depending how early in the month it was bought.[30] If an existing licence is renewed on time, the new licence will last the full 12 months.

The BBC sometimes issues 'short dated' licences in situations when a licence is renewed after the expiry date of the previous licence. The BBC does this as it assumes that TV was being watched in the interim period between expiry and renewal. Short dated licences are set to expire 12 months after the previous expiry date.[31]

If a UK resident aged 74 years wishes to purchase a TV Licence, they can apply for a short-term TV Licence to cover the time until they reach 75 when they become eligible for a free licence in the UK. Short-term licences for 74-year-olds are also available on the Isle of Man and Guernsey.

If a TV licence is no longer needed for an address it is possible to cancel a licence and apply for a partial refund.[32] The amount refunded will depend on the time left to the expiry date. Normally only full quarters (that is three consecutive calendar months) of unexpired licence period are refunded.[33]

The BBC may also revoke a licence under certain circumstances.[33]
Cost of a licence
The level of the fee is decided following periodic negotiations between the UK Government and the BBC Trust.[34] From 1988 to 2010, the licence fee was increased annually each April[35] Before 1988, increases in the licence fee happened at irregular intervals, sometimes a few years passing between changes. Between April 2010 and April 2017 the licence fee remained constant at £145.50 per year.[36] As of 1 April 2020, it costs £157.50 for a colour and £53 for a black and white TV Licence.
